# 2025-10-01-LOG-AI-highlight-hue-fallback

## Work Completed
- Added HighlightText and Frame roles to the generator and rewired the RON template so active rows/tabs reuse the high-contrast text while borders/rails share a frame colour.
- Bumped the default cluster count to 30 and updated the on_song_change hook accordingly.
- Began integrating OKLCH conversions to support hue-aware guardrails; added helper functions in `src/color.rs`.
- Implemented background-derived fallback when the solver can’t find an active highlight above the contrast floor and scoped hue-rotation logic for next steps.

## Session Commits
- No new commits yet; all changes currently reside in the working tree pending hue-guardrail completion.

## Issues Encountered
- Tightened guardrails pushed accent toward neutral greys, making the “playing but not selected” row hard to read. Need a dedicated playing-row style so accent isn’t the only styling lever for that state.
- Hue-separation helper in progress; not yet wired into the solver, so existing outputs remain largely luminance-driven.

## Tests Added
- None yet (manual bench generation only). Plan to add regression outputs once hue guardrails are stable.

## Next Steps
- Finalise hue-aware selection and the playing-row style (AI-IMP-021/022).
- Commit the current refactor once hue guards are enforced.
- Regenerate benchmark covers and capture before/after JSON for review.
