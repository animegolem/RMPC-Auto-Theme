# 2025-10-01-LOG-AI-deterministic-solver-and-overlay-epic

## Work Completed
Established a new epic (AI-EPIC-003) to move the generator from sequential color picks to a deterministic pairwise solver, adopt OKLCH for cleaner adjustments, and support a user-editable base theme overlay. Filed three implementation tickets (AI-IMP-013/014/015). Tightened guardrails iteratively (accent/active vs bg/text, added peer checks), added version reporting to the CLI and JSON, and adjusted k defaults and thresholds to probe options. Scoped terminal clears in the forked rmpc to tabs that need it and prepared a patch + explanation earlier in the day. Documented changes in README and RAG.

## Session Commits
Edited generator logic (src/rmpc_theme_gen.rs) to add guardrail struct, peer checks, origin/debug fields, and version stamping. Updated README (usage, guardrails, version). Maintained on_song_change.sh k defaults during tuning. Added new epic and IMP docs under RAG/. No external commits pushed; all changes are local to this repo.

## Issues Encountered
Threshold tuning produced mixed visual outcomes; some light-tan palettes regressed despite better formal contrast. Sequential selection remained a structural limitation. We also saw user confusion verifying deployments; adding `--version` and JSON version fields addresses this. Terminal artifacting required selective clears in rmpc, captured separately with a patch.

## Tests Added
No automated tests added. Performed manual smoke checks by generating themes and inspecting JSON output (contrast fields and origins). Future tickets (AI-IMP-013/016) will add a debug matrix and a regression harness.

## Next Steps
Implement AI-IMP-013: pairwise accent/active solver with matrix scoring and JSON debug. Follow with AI-IMP-014 to switch adjustments to OKLCH. Begin AI-IMP-015 to overlay computed colors onto a user-supplied base.ron and wire a simple config loader. Validate on a curated 50-cover set and capture results.
