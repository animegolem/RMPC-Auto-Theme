# AI-IMP-009-regression-testing-and-docs

## Summary of Issue
Phase-two features require validation and guidance. We need automated checks that fail when gutter colors or contrast thresholds regress, and updates to README/TEST-RESULTS to explain usage and verification steps. Completion is an expanded test harness that exercises new flags and logic, plus refreshed documentation for contributors.

### Out of Scope 
- Implementing the core gutter/contrast logic (handled by other IMPs).
- External CI integration beyond repository scripts.

### Design/Approach  
Extend `test-results/run-tests.sh` (or add Rust integration tests) to run the generator twice: default run confirming scrollbar colors match background, and contrast-stress run verifying reported ratios. Capture outputs in `TEST-RESULTS.md` with instructions for manual review. Update README sections (Quick Start / Troubleshooting) to mention new flags and expectations.

### Files to Touch
- `test-results/run-tests.sh`: add scenarios and assertions.
- `test-results/TEST-RESULTS.md`: document new cases and sample outputs.
- `README.md`: describe flags, contrast guarantees, verification steps.
- Possibly `RAG/PROGRESS.md` if we log QA outcomes.

### Implementation Checklist
<CRITICAL_RULE>
Before marking an item complete on the checklist MUST **stop** and **think**. Have you validated all aspects are **implemented** and **tested**? 
</CRITICAL_RULE> 
- [ ] Extend integration test script to validate scrollbar colors and contrast ratios using `jq` or helper tools.
- [ ] Add fixtures / references in `TEST-RESULTS.md` illustrating expected outputs.
- [ ] Update README with instructions for the new flag and contrast behaviour.
- [ ] Run the enhanced tests and capture logs in `test-results/`.
 
### Acceptance Criteria
**Scenario:** Running regression script.
**GIVEN** the repository has the enhanced generator,
**WHEN** `test-results/run-tests.sh` executes,
**THEN** it validates scrollbar color equality and contrast thresholds, exiting with zero on success,
**AND** produces updated artifacts referenced in `TEST-RESULTS.md`.
